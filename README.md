# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
### Artemis Financial, a consulting company that designs personalized financial plans for clients covering savings, retirement, investments, and insurance, aims to modernize its operations by prioritizing software security. Their objective was to safeguard their organization from external threats, emphasizing secure communications, especially considering the sensitive financial data and potential international transactions they manage. The main aim of Artemis Financial was to strengthen the security of their RESTful web application against external threats. This involved conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment to detect security weaknesses in their software application.
# What did you do very well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?
### A notable strength in meeting the client's requirements was implementing an organized strategy to determine vulnerabilities. This approach involved a meticulous manual review of the code, which successfully uncovered various security issues, including hard-coded credentials and insufficient error handling. The importance of secure coding practices cannot be overstated, as they play a crucial role in protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches, ultimately safeguarding the company's reputation and financial health.
# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
### Engaging in the manual code review was notably challenging yet enlightening, as it demanded a thorough analysis of the code to identify subtle security issues that automated tools might overlook. Implementing the Maven Dependency-Check plugin established practicality in automating the detection of vulnerabilities in the code dependencies.
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
### A multi-layered defense approach was adopted to enhance the security of the software application. Each layer was specifically tailored to handle different aspects of security threats. Through AES encryption, sensitive data is effectively safeguarded in storage and transmission. This additional layer of security ensures that the data remains inaccessible unless the correct encryption keys are used. Utilizing HTTPS protocols across all communications safeguards against intruding and most common attacks, preserving the confidentiality of data starting from taken as input through its storage. Using OWASP Dependency-Check and similar tools for vulnerability scanning of dependencies helps establish a continuous assessment layer, which assists in identifying and mitigating new vulnerabilities. Similar approaches will be utilized in the future. 
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
### Unit tests and security-focused code reviews are part of the development process to guarantee the code's and application's functionality and security. Following the refactoring process, tools such as SonarQube could conduct an additional round of security testing, ensuring no new vulnerabilities are introduced.
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
### Following secure coding standards and enforcing best practices during code reviews are essential practices. Maven Dependency-Check was a significant resource in this regard.
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
### The comprehensive vulnerability assessment report presented in this assignment demonstrates a detailed understanding of software security. Including manual code reviews and integrating security testing tools further illustrates a solid commitment to developing secure software, which is highly sought after by potential employers in technology-driven industries.
